WikiCal
=======

This program takes two command line arguments, a begin date and an end date
in the format DD-MM-YYYY, and generates on its standard output a LaTeX file
that pdflatex compiles to a A5-booklet calender  with each day annotated by
the contents of its corresponding  filename in the subdirectory days. These
files were generated using the program wikiscraper, also included.
